            But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born and I will give you a 
            complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human 
            happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to 
            pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or 
            desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can 
            procure him some great pleasure.
